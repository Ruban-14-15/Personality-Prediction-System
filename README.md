# Personality-Prediction-System
we predict personality traits using Python and machine learning, focusing on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). Key Python libraries are used for data analysis and modeling. The process includes data visualization, model training, and applying predictions to Kaggle user commands, revealing ESFP as the most common personality type.
